# Sierpinski Demo

These are the rules to generate the Sierpinski triangle:

1. Set three points that define a triangle.
2. Randomly select a point anywhere *(x,y)*

Then:

1. Randomly select one of the triangle points.
2. Set the new *x,y* to be the midpoint between the previous *x,y* and the 
triange point.
3. Repeat.
