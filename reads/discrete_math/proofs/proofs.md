Theorem:

A chess board 8x8 without two opposite corners cannot be tiled by 1x2 dominos.

Proof:
- Black and white cells, 4 black / 4 white
- the number of black or white cells are not balanced and each domino uses
one black and one white.


## Proofs for existencial statements

- clain: object with given properties exists
- proof: an example
- one example is enough

## Cutting figure

congruent pieces: of the same shape and size
