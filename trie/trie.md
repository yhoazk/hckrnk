# Trie

A trie is a data structure, primarly desgined for strings, it is similar to trees,
but it is dfferent in its usage and application.

- The first node is null
- Each element contains a reference to every possible child, even if the reference
 is null.
- Then, the size of a trie is directly proportional to the alphabet used.


## Example:

Create a trie to contain the rhym: __peter piper picked a oecj of picked peppers__
