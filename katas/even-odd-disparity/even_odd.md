# [Even odd disparity](https://www.codewars.com/kata/even-odd-disparity/train/python)

Given an array, return the difference between the count of even numbers and the count of odd numbers. 0 will be considered an even number.

For example, `solve([0,1,2,3]) = 0` because there are two even numbers and two odd numbers. `Even - Odd = 2 - 2 = 0.`

Let's now add two letters to the last example: `solve([0,1,2,3,'a','b']) = 0.` Again, `Even - Odd = 2 - 2 = 0.` Ignore letters.

The input will be an array of lowercase letters and numbers only.

Good luck!
