## `href`

**H**yperlink **ref**erences can be divided in relative and absolute. Absolute
links are quite simple, but relative links can be divided into two further 
categories: "document-relative" and "site-root-relative".

### Absolute links

This `href` links contains a complete internet address, this includes the 
`http[s]://`. This link will always work as long as the destination page exists.

```html
<a href="http://www.mysite.com/index.html">Go To My Site</a>
```

### Relative links

#### Document-Relative Links

    

#### Site-root-relative links
