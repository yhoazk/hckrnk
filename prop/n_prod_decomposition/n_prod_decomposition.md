# n product decomposition

Is possible to create a program to decompose an integer in it's n conformig
products?


Subproblems:

Decompose the given integer into its prime factors, an integer will not have
more elements of its product than the number of prime numbers forming it.

This is based on the fundamental teorem of the algebra which says that any 
number its prime or it is formed of a unique set of prime numbers which can
be repeated.
